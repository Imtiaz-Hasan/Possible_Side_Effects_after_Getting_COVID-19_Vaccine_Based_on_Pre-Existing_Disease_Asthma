# Possible Side Effects after Getting COVID-19 Vaccine Based on Pre-Existing Disease: Asthma

This repository contains the code and analysis for the research paper investigating possible side effects of COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer, and Janssen) in individuals with pre-existing asthma conditions.

## Abstract

Vaccination could be a critical preventative strategy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and it is essential to understand the vaccine's usability in the general population. A safe and effective vaccination is the most effective way to terminate this epidemic. Many communities throughout the globe have expressed concerns regarding the efficacy and side effects of coronavirus SARS CoV2 vaccinations. Vaccines are now being rushed to market. Many papers have been published on COVID-19 vaccine, hesitancy, acceptance rate, local survey, vaccine distribution, vaccine information, etc. However, none of them mentioned any potential side effects from the COVID-19 vaccination for those with pre-existing disease like Asthma. The study aimed to describe the possible side effects after getting COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer and Janssen) for those who have a pre-existing disease like Asthma.
